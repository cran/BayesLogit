BayesLogit has been completely re-organized. Previously, the package was derived
from a repository used for a doctoral thesis, and included many items beyond
what was necessary for an R package. This made the subsequent package difficult
to maintain.

The new package and repository (<https://github.com/jwindle/BayesLogit>) has
been slimmed down and now is focused on implementation of PolyaGamma sampling
methods.

Thanks to to Jari Oksanen and James Balamuta for their help in getting the
package ready for CRAN.
